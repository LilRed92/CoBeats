In a society as technologically sophisticated as ours, most projects will require the coordinated contributions of several skillful people. Whether the task is starting a new business venture or creating a hit song, one person shouldn't hope to accomplish it entirely alone.

Thus, collaborative technology has revolutionized the way we work. 

Google Docs collaboration changed radically how we read and write documents together. Github collaboration reimagined how we can  program alongside others. And in this tutorial I will show you how you can use PubNub to create a simple Music recording app with realtime collaborative capabilities. To see what I'm referring to checkout my demo [here](http://pubnub.github.io/CoBeats/). Though I will not teach you how to make the entire demo you can always checkout my project repo [here](https://github.com/pubnub/CoBeats/).

This tutorial will focus on adding PubNub to make a music app collaborative; however, many of the practices we use here can be used to customize your own type of collaborative app.
